# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### Manual Deploy

1. Run `firebase login`
1. Initialize project with `firebase init`
1. Build Project: `npm run build`
1. Confirm Firebase config by running locally: `firebase serve`
1. Deploy to Firebase (everything including Hosting and Functions): `firebase deploy`

**NOTE:** You can use `firebase serve` to test how your application will work when deployed to Firebase, but make sure you run `npm run build` first.
